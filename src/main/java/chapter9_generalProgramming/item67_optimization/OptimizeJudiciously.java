    //1. More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without
    //   necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason—including blind stupidity.

    //2. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

    //3. We follow two rules in the matter of optimization:
    //   Rule 1. Don’t do it.
    //   Rule 2 (for experts only). Don’t do it yet—that is, not until you have a perfectly clear and unoptimized solution.

    //Strive to write good programs rather than fast ones
    //Strive to avoid design decisions that limit performance
    //Consider the performance consequences of your API design decisions
    //It is a very bad idea to warp an API to achieve good performance
