    //To document your API properly, you must precede every exported class, interface, constructor, method, and field declaration with a doc comment
    //The doc comment for a method should describe succinctly the contract between the method and its client
    //doc comments should be readable both in the source code and in the generated documentation
    //no two members or constructors in a class or interface should have the same summary description
    //When documenting a generic type or method, be sure to document all type parameters
    //When documenting an enum type, be sure to document the constants
    //When documenting an annotation type, be sure to document any members
    //Whether or not a class or static method is threadsafe, you should document its thread-safety level
